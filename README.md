In this project i used a PIR sensor for detecting motion, when motion is detected the sensor starts the camera which takes a photo, after that using the Cloud vision OCR API i detect the text from the image transfering it to firebase.
The hole purpose of the project is to identify car plates and have a website with all car plates that were dectede by the motion sensor.
